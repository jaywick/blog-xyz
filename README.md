# Prerequisites
* mongodb
* Typescript 1.8+
* Node 5+
* vscode (optional, but seriously recommended)

Get the packages dependancies

    npm install 

The build process simply involves transpiling Typescript to JS

    tsc -p .

With `mongod` running, run

    node entry.js

Or in vscode simply click <kbd>F5</kbd> to debug using Node.
